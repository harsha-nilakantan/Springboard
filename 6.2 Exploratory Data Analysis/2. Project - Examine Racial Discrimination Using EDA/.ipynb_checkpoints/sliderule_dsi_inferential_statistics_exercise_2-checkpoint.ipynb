    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "Though the t-test suggested that our difference was statistically significant w.r.t to the original posed question, if we were to truly model the problem, we would also see that there are so many other factors (65 total no of columns of data) that would play into this. So, this race-based differentiation, might on the surface seem significant when only analyzed with these two variables. But in truth, it must be analyzed with more than just the proportion of call backs, and if they were black or white-sounding."

It isolated one portion of the data and sought to understand the effects seen on only the outcome. Such an analysis is incomplete, given how much more data there is, and lots of other actors to consider such as the education, no of jobs held, total years of experience etc. So, if we were to redo our analyses, we would use as many factors as we can to look into the problem and understand our outcomes better."
